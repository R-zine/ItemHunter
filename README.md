# ItemHunter
AI-powered app where you search for items in a quest to find them all!

## Stack

This app is built with Expo and utilizes Redux for state management and data persistence. The AI model is integrated using TensorFlowJS.

## Installation

To run this app, you need to have either a mobile device with the Expo app installed on it, or an emulator which is set up locally. For Windows users, officially, only an Android emulator is available through Android Studio. MacOS users can setup and emulator for either mobile OS.

To install the codebase, first run npm i --legacy-peer-deps. If needed, also run npx expo install. If everything is successful, you can start the dev environment using npx expo. You will need to connect Expo to the mobile Expo app through the QR code that will appear in the terminal.
